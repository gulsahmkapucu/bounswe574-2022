# How to contribute to this project
First of all, we like to mention again that this project is a strict group project for a university course. Therefore, no contribution is allowed from people other than the Group 4 members in SWE 574 Fall 2022. This document merely is a guideline for group members.

1. First action to be taken before any code contribution is creating an issue about the subject of the contribution. If you have something new in your mind or you discovered a bug, please create an issue for that before typing any code. Make sure you attach related labels to the issue. In addition, please assign the issue to someone who will be responsible for that issue. All commits and pull requests should be associated with an issue.

2. This project embraces [feature branch workflow](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html). Hence, after creating the issue, please create a new branch for that new feature or bug from the latest version of the main branch. Make your code changes on that new branch.

3. After you finished the development, commit your changes locally and push that branch to this repository.

4. On GitHub, create a pull request for that branch to be merged to the main branch. Make sure another team member review the code and approve.

5. Solve any merge conflicts if necessary.
